A substantial deviation of a Licensed Product from the specifications in the corresponding Documentation will not be considered a breach of this agreement that allows you to terminate the agreement, but it could give rise to a warranty claim under section 8.

7.2 Consequences of Termination:  If and when either you or Synopsys terminates this agreement, all Purchasing Agreements in effect at that time will also terminate.  When this agreement, a Purchasing Agreement or an individual license to a Licensed Product expires or is terminated:
(a) you must 
(i) immediately cease all use of the Licensed Products, Documentation, and Design Techniques, 
(ii) promptly return to Synopsys or destroy all copies of the Licensed Products and Documentation in your possession or control, and 
(iii) certify in writing to Synopsys that you have complied with clauses (i) and (ii);
(b) you will remain obligated to pay any amounts you owe to Synopsys at that time; and
(c) the provisions of sections 4, 6, 7.2, 8.4 and 10, and the warranty disclaimers in section 8, will remain in effect.

8.  Limited Warranty

8.1 Warranty:  For a period of 90 days from when Synopsys delivers a Licensed Product to you (the "warranty period"), Synopsys warrants that the Licensed Product will have no Errors when used on the correct platform and according to the instructions in the corresponding Documentation.  This warranty will be void if you, or anyone else other than Synopsys, modifies or attempts to modify the Licensed Product.

8.2 Warranty Claims:  To claim a breach of this warranty, you must, during the warranty period, notify Synopsys in writing of the Error or Errors that you have encountered and provide Synopsys with all the information you have, in written or electronic form, about those Errors, so that Synopsys can attempt to reproduce, diagnose, and correctthe Errors.

8.3 Exclusive Remedy:  Your exclusive remedy for any breach of this warranty is that Synopsys will use commercially reasonable efforts to (at Synopsys's option) correct the Errors you have reported or provide a replacement product that does not contain these Errors, or if Synopsys is unable to provide a correction or a replacement or determines that it will not be feasible to do so, Synopsys will refund the Fees you paid for that Licensed Product.

8.4 Disclaimer:  This is the only warranty Synopsys provides for the Licensed Products.  Except for this warranty, all Licensed Products, Documentation, and Design Techniques are provided "AS IS".  Synopsys disclaims all other warranties (express, implied, or statutory), including any warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, or non-infringement and any warranties arising from a course of dealing or usage of trade.

9.  Infringement Claims

9.1 Indemnity:  Synopsys will, at its own expense, defend (or at its option, settle) any claim asserted against you by a third party that any Licensed Product you obtained from Synopsys under this agreement infringes any U.S. patent, copyright, trademark, or trade secret.  Synopsys will indemnify you for any damages you suffer and costs you reasonably incur that are directly attributable to any such claim and that are assessed against you in a final judgment or agreed upon by Synopsys in a settlement.

9.2 Conditions:  Synopsys's obligations to defend and indemnify you with respect to a particular claim are subject to the following conditions:
(a) you must promptly give Synopsys written notice of the claim;
(b) you must give Synopsys sole control and authority over the defense and settlement of the claim; and
(c) you must provide Synopsys with all information you have regarding the claim and cooperate with Synopsys when Synopsys defends or attempts to settle the claim.

9.3 Pro-Active Steps:  If any Licensed Product is, or Synopsys believes is likely to become, the subject of a claim for which Synopsys would be obligated to defend and indemnify you, then Synopsys may, at its option, do any of the following:
(a) obtain for you (at no cost to you) the right for you to continue using the Licensed Product as permitted by this agreement;
(b) replace or modify the Licensed Product to avoid the infringement problem, as long as there is no material loss of functionality; or
(c) if Synopsys reasonably concludes that it will not be feasible to do either of the above, terminate your license for the Licensed Product and give you a prorated refund (based on how much of the License Term has elapsed) of the Fees you paid for that license.

9.4 Exclusions:  Synopsys will have no obligation to defend or indemnify you (notwithstanding the first paragraphof this section) with respect to any claim that is based on or attributable to any of the following:
(a) any modification made to the Licensed Product by anyone other than Synopsys;
(b) the combination or use of the Licensed Product with other products, processes, or materials not supplied by Synopsys or specified in the Documentation as being necessary to use the Licensed Product;
(c) your continued engagement in infringing activities after you were notified of the infringement or after Synopsys informed you of a modification or workaround that would have avoided the infringement; and
(d) your use of the Licensed Product in a manner not permitted by this agreement.

9.5 No Other Obligations:  Except as expressly stated in this section 9, Synopsys has no obligation or liability to you for any actual or alleged infringement related to the Licensed Products, Documentation, or Design Techniques.  

10.  Other Terms

10.1 Ownership of IP Rights: Synopsys and its licensors own all Intellectual Property Rights in the Licensed Products, Documentation, and Design Techniques.  Your only rights in the Licensed Products, Documentation, and Design Techniques are the rights expressly granted in this agreement; all other rights are reserved by Synopsys.  Synopsys's licensors are third-party beneficiaries of, and thus may enforce against you, the license restrictions and confidentiality obligations in this agreement with respect to their intellectual property and proprietary information. You will own all Intellectual Property Rights in the Designs you create using the Licensed Products, Documentation, and Design Techniques, subject to Synopsys's (and its licensors') ownership of the Intellectual Property Rights in the Licensed Products, Documentation, and Design Techniques.  Synopsys may freely use and disseminate any Feedback you provide.  You agree not to claim that Synopsys owes you any compensation for its use or dissemination of such Feedback.

10.2 Audit and Compliance: Synopsys may audit (using its own employees and those of an independent auditing firm that is subject to appropriate confidentiality obligations) your use of the Licensed Products and Documentation to verify your compliance with this agreement.  You agree to give Synopsys (or the auditing firm) reasonable access to your facilities and records for purposes of conducting these audits.  Synopsys will give you at least five days advance notice before conducting an audit.  Audits will be conducted during normal business hours and no more than once per year, unless Synopsys has a good-faith basis for believing that more frequent audits are warranted.  Synopsys will bear all the costs it incurs (including the fees and expenses of the auditing firm, if any) in conducting an audit, unless the audit reveals that you have failed to comply with this agreement in a material way, in which case you agree to reimburse Synopsys for these costs.

10.3 Limitation of Liability: For each product or service you license or purchase from Synopsys under this agreement, Synopsys's total, cumulative liability to you, including under section 9, is limited to the amount of Fees you paid for that product or service (regardless of the nature of the liability or the nature or number of claims giving rise to the liability).  Synopsys will not, under any circumstances or any theory of liability, be liable to you for any lost profits, loss of data, or consequential, incidental, or special damages arising from this agreement or the products and services provided to you under this agreement.  However, this disclaimer of Synopsys's liability for consequential damages does not limit or reduce Synopsys's obligations to defend and indemnify you under section 9.  The limitations of liability in this section are a fundamental part of this agreement and enable Synopsys to provide products and services to you at lower prices.  These limitations of liability are intended to apply even if an exclusive remedy is found to have failed of its essential purpose.  

10.4  Export Controls: You agree that the goods, software, and technology subject to this agreement are subject to the export control laws and regulations of the United States, including but not limited to the Export Administration Regulations ("EAR"), and sanctions regulations of the U.S. Department of Treasury, Office of Foreign Asset Controls and that you will comply with these laws and regulations.  Without limiting the foregoing, you will not, without a U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security license or license exception, 
(i) export, re-export, or transfer any technology, software, or source code subject to this agreement, either directly or indirectly, to any national of any country identified in Country Groups D:1 or E:2 as defined in the EARs, or 
(ii) export to any country identified in Country Groups D:1 or E:2 the direct product of the technology, software or source code, if such foreign produced product is subject to the national security controls as identified on the Commerce Control List ("CCL").  In addition, goods, software and any technology subject to this agreement may not be exported, reexported, or transferred to 
(a) any person or entity listed on the "Entity List", "Denied Persons List" or the list of "Specifically Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons" as such lists are maintained by the U.S. Government, or 
(b) an end-user engaged in activities related to weapons of mass destruction.  Such activities include but are not necessarily limited to activities related to: 
(1) the design, development, production, or use of nuclear materials, nuclear facilities, or nuclear weapons; 
(2) the design, development, production, or use of missiles or support of missiles projects; and 
(3) the design, development, production, or use of chemical or biological weapons.  

10.5 Governing Law; Jurisdiction: This agreement is governed by the laws of the United States and the State of California, without regard to conflicts of laws principles.  The federal and state courts located in Santa Clara County, California have exclusive jurisdiction over any disputes arising from or relating to this agreement, and each party consents to such jurisdiction and venue.  

10.6 Notices: Any notice, approval, consent, or other communication intended to have legal effect under this agreement must be given to the other party in writing, must be sent by first-class, registered, or overnight mail or private overnight courier (to the address for the other party stated on the signature page, unless the other party has given notice of a new address), and will be deemed given upon receipt or when delivery is refused.  A copy of any communication sent to Synopsys must also be sent to the attention of the General Counsel.

10.7 Waivers: Either party's failure to enforce any provision of this agreement will not be deemed a waiver of the future enforcement of that provision or enforcement of any other provision.  In order to be binding, a waiver must be in writing and signed by the party giving the waiver.

10.8 Independent Contractors: The parties to this agreement are independent contractors.  Neither party is the agent or partner of the other party, or has any power or authority to act on behalf of the other party.

10.9 Severability: If any provision in this agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable as written, the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect and the invalid or unenforceable provision is to be construed (and, if necessary, modified) so that it is valid and enforceable to the greatest extent possible.

10.10 Attorneys' Fees: The prevailing party in any action to enforce this agreement will be entitled to recover costs and expenses including reasonable attorneys' fees.

10.11 Remedies: Except where this agreement expressly provides exclusive remedies, all rights and remedies of either party (including termination rights) are cumulative. You agree that monetary damages alone would not be an adequate remedy, and therefore Synopsys will be entitled to injunctive relief if you materially breach the license restrictions or confidentiality provisions in this agreement.

10.12 Force Majeure: Each party will be excused from performance of its obligations under this agreement, except payment obligations, to the extent that performance is rendered impossible by earthquake, fire, flood, governmental action, labor disruptions, supplier failures, or any other event or circumstance beyond that party's reasonable control.

10.13 Construction: Section headings in this agreement are for convenience only.  The word "including" (and variations thereof) is not intended to be limiting.  No rule of strict construction is to be used when interpreting this agreement.
